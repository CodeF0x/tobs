<h2 align="center" id="what">What is TOBS?</h2>

### TOBS is a customizable cross-platform system monitor app.

It shows you the most important information about your system in an instant using comprehensible charts.<br>
With customizable options like refreshrate, dark- and light mode, drag- and drop alignment of the charts and some more, you can make Tobs your very own experience.

**TOBS is almost fully customizable. You are able to adjust the following settings:**

- Refreshrate of data
- Select if data shall be displayed in GiB (Gibibyte) or GB (Gigabyte)
- Switch between Dark- and Light mode
- Chartlayout customizable with drag and drop

<h2 align="center" id="install">Installing TOBS</h2>

**The TOBS installation is pretty straigt forward.**

To get started, download the latest [release](https://github.com/CodeF0x/tobs/releases) or clone the master to your computer.

**_Make sure you have Node installed!_**

Open an Commandprompt/Terminal inside the TOBS folder and run _npm install_.

After that, use _npm start_ to launch TOBS.

<h2 align="center" id="known-issues">Known issues and drawbacks</h2>

**Just like with every piece of software, TOBS also has some known issues and drawbacks.**

- You can't monitor your graphics card with TOBS, as it lacks a proper API to get GPU data. The only information TOBS can display about your GPU are:

  - GPU name
  - Total VRAM
  - Bus

- Due to Linux's permission system, there is no direct Linux support right now. Technically, TOBS should run on Linux, but with issues (e. g. missing / incorrect data, etc.)
